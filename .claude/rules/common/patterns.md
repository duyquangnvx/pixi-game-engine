# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Evaluate candidates on security, extensibility, and relevance
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Define standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Concrete implementations handle storage details (database, API, file, etc.)
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not the storage mechanism
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing with mocks
